# LoRa Packet Multiplexer

The LoRa Packet Multiplexer utility forwards the [Semtech packet-forwarder](https://github.com/lora-net/packet_forwarder)
UDP data to multiple endpoints. It makes it possible to connect a single
LoRa gateway to multiple networks. It is part of the [LoRa Server project](https://www.loraserver.io).
